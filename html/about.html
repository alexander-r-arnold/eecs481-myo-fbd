      <h2><u> About the Creators </u></h2>
      <p>The Myo Team is composed of Alex Arnold, Jordan Ridenour, Andrew Chen, and Ryan Jackson. The team formed in Fall 2016 for the EECS 481 -- Software Engineering class at the University of Michigan as the group's senior capstone project.</p>
      <h2><u> Motivation </u></h2>
      <p>The Myo Free Body Diagram and Equation Editor was created to help Brad, a student studying Aerospace Engineering, create free body diagrams and equations during his classes or while studying. Brad's limited movement makes interacting with most modern software very difficult and time consuming, especially when it comes to create complex free body diagrams in Aerospace Engineering class. In order to relieve the limited movement Brad has, this project focuses on leveraging the Myo Armband in order to make creating free body diagrams easy and much less time consuming. The Myo Armband is a gesture control armband that registers micro-muscle movements in the wearer's forearm. This software will take the data received from the armband and allows the user to interact with the software entirely just by moving their hand and arm. The software almost entirely removes the necessity to use a mouse or the keyboard. More on the actual controls and gesture commands can be found in the help page.</p>
