# eecs481-myo-fbd

This application was built by Alex Arnold, Jordan Ridenour, Andrew Chen, and Ryan Jackson as their EECS 481 Project at the University of Michigan. This is a cross-platform [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) application.

## About

This project's goal was to leverage the Myo armband so that users can create free body diagrams without using a mouse or the keyboard. 

## Supported Platforms

Since electron is cross-platform, it will work on most Desktop OSs as long as they have npm, node.js, and the corresponding dependencies installed that are declared in the package.json.

## How to run

```sh
# only one time
npm install

# everytime to start the program
npm start
```

## Notes

1. Although this project was aimed at using the myo armband, the software can function completely independent without the use of the Myo.

## License and Distribution

TBD
